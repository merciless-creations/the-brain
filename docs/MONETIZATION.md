## Churn Reduction Strategy

### Why Non-Fiction Authors Churn

1. **Book is finished** - Natural completion point
2. **Slow progress** - Lose momentum
3. **Price sensitivity** - Budget constraints
4. **Feature gaps** - Missing critical functionality

### Retention Tactics

#### 1. Progress-Based Retention
- Weekly "progress report" emails
- Milestone celebrations (50%, 75%, 100% done)
- "What's next?" prompts after book completion
- Template for next book type

#### 2. Value Reminders
- Monthly newsletter: "Author success stories"
- Feature spotlight emails
- Usage stats: "You've written X words this month"
- AI token savings calculator: "Saved $X in editing costs"

#### 3. Pause Option
**"Hibernate Mode"** - $5/month
- Keep all data
- No AI features
- Read-only access
- Resume anytime at full price

Reduces hard churn by 30-40%.

#### 4. Exit Surveys
Automated when canceling:
