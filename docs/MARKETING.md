# **How to Market a Non-Fiction Ghostwriting MVP (Step-by-Step)**

You’re entering a niche with a *very clear* ICP:
**non-fiction authors, book coaches, editors, entrepreneurs writing books, thought-leaders turning seminars into books.**

You do *not* need mass marketing.
You need **30–100 serious early adopters**.

Here is the playbook.

---

# **Phase 1 — Positioning (Before You Talk to Anyone)**

## **1. Choose a narrow wedge**

You **cannot** launch “Sudowrite for non-fiction.” Too broad.
Pick your *first* micro-niche:

Examples:

* “AI for business book authors”
* “AI for pastors writing books”
* “AI for health & wellness authors”
* “AI for course creators turning modules into books”
* “AI for CEOs writing thought-leadership books”

The narrower, the easier the traction.

## **2. Name the category**

People don’t buy tools — they buy categories.
You define it first.

Examples:

* “AI Research-Integrated Drafting”
* “AI-Structured Nonfiction Writing”
* “AI Ghostwriting Engine for Nonfiction”

This matters more than people realize.

---

# **Phase 2 — Message + Landing Page**

Create a landing page before a full marketing push.

## **Landing Page Structure (simple, high converting)**

**Header:**
“Finish your non-fiction book 5× faster without losing your voice.”

**Subheader:**
“AI that organizes, drafts, and revises with you — based on your outline, notes, and research.”

**Three bullets:**

* Transform outlines into usable chapters
* Summarize research and integrate it into your manuscript
* Keep tone + structure consistent across the entire book

**CTA:**
“Join the private beta” (email form only)

**Proof:**
Add 3 example use cases:

* Business book
* Memoir
* Thought leadership nonfiction

**Demo video** (2–3 minutes) — optional but extremely effective.

---

# **Phase 3 — Direct Community Penetration (The Part That Actually Works)**

## **1. Go where nonfiction writers hang out**

You avoid generic “AI” communities. Wrong audience.

Go here:

### **Facebook groups**

Search:

* “Nonfiction Authors Network”
* “Write Your Book”
* “Business Authors”
* “Self-Publishing School Community”
* “Memoir Writing Group”

These groups have 10k–80k members each.

**Tactic:**
Post valuable content, not promotions:

* “Here’s the exact workflow I use to turn raw notes into a chapter”
* “Here’s a template to structure any nonfiction book in 10 minutes”
* “Here’s how to summarize a 30-page research paper instantly”

Then link to your waitlist.

---

## **2. Book coaches are kingmakers**

One book coach = 10–30 authors per year.

Email/message a few dozen of them:

* “I built a tool designed specifically for nonfiction authors to turn outlines into structured chapters + integrate research. Want early access?”

Offer:

* Free account for 1 year
* Revenue share for referrals (20–30%)

This flips them into evangelists immediately.

---

## **3. Author podcasts and YouTube channels**

Low competition. Easy to get on as a guest.

Pitch angle:
“What AI can actually do for nonfiction authors — and what it can’t.”

You don’t even have to talk about your product until the end.

---

# **Phase 4 — Content Strategy (Low Volume, High Value)**

## **Never blog generic “writing tips.” Dead on arrival.**

Instead create:

* **Case studies**: “How I expanded a 6-bullet outline into a 2,100-word draft chapter.”
* **Before/after comparisons** of AI rewrites
* **Full workflows** for nonfiction authors (people love step-by-steps)
* **Deep technical breakdowns** of your consistency checker or research summarizer

Each post ends with:

> “Try the private beta — I’m onboarding 10 nonfiction authors this month.”

One good YouTube video showing “outline → 3,000-word draft → polished chapter” is worth 100 tweets.

---

# **Phase 5 — Create One Killer Demo That Destroys All Skepticism**

Before and after examples convert better than ads.

Make a single 4-minute video:

1. Import outline
2. Expand into sections
3. Pull in research
4. Draft 1,200 words
5. Rewrite for clarity
6. Export to DOCX

This demo alone will generate early sales.

---

# **Phase 6 — Paid Experiments (Only After 20–30 Users)**

If your messaging is proven:

* Facebook ads targeting “authors,” “self-publishing,” “book coaches”
* Lead magnet: “10 Nonfiction Chapter Templates (AI-Friendly)”

Collect emails → invite to beta → convert to monthly subscribers.

Do NOT start ads before you know your ICP, or you'll set money on fire.

---

# **Phase 7 — Conversion Strategy**

## **Early pricing (simple)**

* **$19/mo** for writers
* **$49/mo** for book coaches
* **$199/year** for anyone who wants a discount

Add an optional:

* **$299 one-time onboarding session** (surprisingly effective)

## **Offer a limited Pioneer tier**

"Founding Authors Plan — $99/year — price locked forever."

Scarcity works.

---

# **Phase 8 — Retention Strategy**

Nonfiction authors write slowly. Don’t let them churn.

Inside the product:

* Weekly “Write With Me” AI prompts
* Progress tracking
* “Next best task” suggestions
* Templates for common nonfiction genres

Outside the product:

* Monthly webinars: “Turn a messy outline into a draft chapter in 12 minutes.”

Retention becomes self-sustaining once people see progress.

---

# **The Most Important Thing**

If you do only **one** thing right:

**Become the guy who teaches nonfiction authors how to use AI — and they will buy anything you build.**

People buy from the person who educates them, not the person who advertises to them.
